# packlist-sinatra-mvc
A basic MVC to organize packing of items into panniers for a bicycle tour.

Users can create secure accounts and create panniers to add to six specified locations on a bicycle.
Users can also create items and assign them to a pannier.

Users can view lists of all the items and panniers they have created, though they can only see panniers and items they themselves have created.
